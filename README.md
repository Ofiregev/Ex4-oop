# The Pokemon Game - Ex4-oop
<p align="center">
In this assignment we were asked to program a game. <br />
The goal of the game is to catch the most pokemon that are updated online on the graph with our players. <br />
In the beginning we get from the server the Properties about the map of the game, that contain graphs, and players (agents).<br />
All the information about our implementation of the game is in our <a href="https://github.com/Ofiregev/Ex4-oop/wiki">Wiki</a> <br />
